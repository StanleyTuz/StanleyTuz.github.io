Thoughts on continuity, differentiability.

Inverse Function Theorem proof (SPIVAK)

Compactness, Heine-Borel (SPIVAK)

Differentiability and partial derivatives (SPIVAK)

Equivalent definitions of derivative: limit, linear approx, etc. (?)

Notion of uniformity; why is uniform convergence the better definition (as compared to pointwise)
